# Calendera — AI-Powered Unified Inbox

**Cal Hacks '25**
Developed by Dean Shahin, Naisha Jain, Kevin Nguyen, Vamika Singhal.

Calendera is an AI-powered communication hub that consolidates messages from Gmail, Slack, Discord, iMessage, WhatsApp, and more into one intelligent dashboard. Using Claude AI, it automatically categorizes messages, extracts calendar events and tasks, and helps you manage your digital life—all in one place.

## Problem

Managing multiple communication platforms is overwhelming:

- **Gmail, Slack, Discord, iMessage, WhatsApp, Telegram** — all separate apps
- Important messages like "let's meet tomorrow at 3pm" get buried in noise
- Manually extracting events and tasks from messages is tedious
- No central place to see what actually matters

Key challenges:

- Context switching between 10+ apps daily
- Missing important events hidden in casual messages
- Drowning in spam, marketing, and low-priority notifications
- No way to quickly ask "what's on my schedule today?"

## 💡 Solution

Calendera uses **Claude AI** to read your messages and automatically organize your digital life.

Connect your accounts, and Calendera:
- **Categorizes every message** into Events, Todos, Social, Recruitment, Spam, etc.
- **Extracts calendar events** from natural language ("coffee tomorrow at 3?" → calendar entry)
- **Finds action items** and deadlines ("send that report by Friday" → todo list)
- **Answers questions** via AI chatbot ("What's on my schedule?", "Any urgent tasks?")

All platforms in one dashboard. All information auto-organized. All accessible through natural language.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calendera.git
cd calendera

# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Or install individually:
# cd frontend && npm install
# cd backend && npm install
```

### Setup Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env.local
```

### Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env
```

### Google OAuth Setup

1. [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) → Create project
2. Enable Gmail API + Google Calendar API
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop app)
4. Download as `credentials.json` → move to `backend/`
5. Run `node index.js` in `backend/` to authorize

### Run

```bash
# From root directory:

# Terminal 1: Frontend
npm run dev:frontend
# Open http://localhost:3000

# Terminal 2: Gmail Monitor
npm run start:backend

# Terminal 3 (optional): Beeper Monitor
npm run start:backend:beeper
```

Or run individually:

```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Backend
cd backend && npm run start

# Beeper
cd backend && npm run beeper
```

## Environment Variables

**Frontend (`frontend/.env.local`):**
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

3. **Extract** — Specialized agents pull out events, tasks, and key info
4. **Display** — Dashboard shows organized messages in clean sections
5. **Interact** — Add to calendar, complete tasks, or chat with AI assistant
